# AdventureWorks PowerBI Dashboard
A project on the publicly available Adventure Works database using SQL to clean and extract the required data and PowerBI to visualize the data.

## Data Acquisition
The data was acquired from the publicly available databases by Microsoft - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms

## Getting the relevant data
The database consisted of a variety of different tables and for the purpose of the project, only a fraction of the data available was used. To do this, SQL queries were 
used to get the data and then stored as .csv files. 

## Dashboard
The dashboard was created keeping two things in mind - Sales and Customers. Therefore, the dashboard visualizes all the information necessary to understand the sales 
numbers as well as the customers. 

(Note - due to the unavailability of the paid version of PowerBI, the dashboard is shown using a .pdf file.)
